### Challenge

A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by two. Write a function called isTwinPrime(_:) which takes an integer and returns `true` if it is a twin prime, or `false` if it is not.

#### Examples
`isTwinPrime(5) //5 returns true.`  
`isTwinPrime(9) //9 returns false.`  
`isTwinPrime(7) //7 returns true.`  
`isTwinPrime(23) //23 returns false`  

***HINT: Use a helper function to first check if a given number is prime.**
